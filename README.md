# CheckThisRepo

This repository marks the first public signal of the **403 Project** — an experimental cryptographic puzzle game.

Every file here is intentional. Some will make sense immediately; others will not.  
Authenticity can be verified through PGP, but the signing key will remain private until **after Drop 002**.  
Until that reveal, you may confirm that files are signed — not by whom.

## 📦 About This Repository

This repository serves as an immutable record for the first stage of the puzzle.

Each stage may include:
- A signed text clue  
- An encrypted payload  
- Metadata or timestamps that matter more than they appear  

Solvers are encouraged to fork, mirror, and collaborate — but should **not** expect answers here.

## 🔐 Files

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `clue1.txt.asc` | A readable message signed with a private PGP key. The key will be released later for public verification. |
| `drop1_payload.gpg` | An encrypted file. It cannot be decrypted until the corresponding public key is published. |
| `README.md` | The document you are reading now. |

---

## 🔎 Hints

> The signature is genuine.  
> The timestamp is deliberate.  
> When the public key appears, trust the fingerprint — not the name.

## 🧠 Objective

1. Collect each signed artifact.  
2. Verify their integrity when the key is revealed.  
3. Observe the sequence, the timing, and the commits.  
4. Assemble the pattern.

Until then — **watch the commits.**
